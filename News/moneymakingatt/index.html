          <p>Alright, buckle up because today, I’m diving into a tale as old as time: the broke college student hustle. Being in college with little-to-no cash flow is a rite of passage, but let’s be real—living off instant noodles and “creative budgeting” can only get you so far. So, I’ve tried a few ways to scrape together some cash, and while I’m not rolling in riches (yet), it’s been...educational. Here are the top three ways I’ve tried to make money.<br><br>
            <b>1. Freelance Tutoring</b><br>
            The classic. I figured, “Hey, I know a thing or two about physics and astronomy, and there are plenty of people who could use a hand with that.” The only problem? Finding people willing to pay for that hand. It turns out, not everyone is thrilled to drop cash for my services, but I’m still convinced tutoring has potential. A work in progress. (or not).<br><br>
            <b>2. Selling Stuff Online</b><br>
            Okay, this one actually wasn’t too bad. I rummaged through some things I didn’t need anymore—books, gadgets, even my mobile legends account that i barely played. Turns out, people will buy practically anything! The only downside? Parting with stuff I thought was worth way more than anyone else did.<br><br>
            <b>3. Starting a Youtube Channel</b><br>
            Yeah, that's right I’m trying to build a Youtube channel about <mark style="background-color: black;">nothing to see here</mark>. Has it made me money? Not yet. But if I stick with it and hit that monetization threshold, who knows? Plus, it’s a fun way to work on something I’m passionate about. Here’s hoping it becomes a side hustle, or at least an excuse to keep talking to a camera :><br><br>
            So, there you have it! Am I richer for it? Well, technically yes, but only by a few paper. If nothing else, I’ve learned that the student hustle is real, and there’s always another idea waiting to be tried.
