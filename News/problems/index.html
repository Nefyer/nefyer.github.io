          <p><p>Think before you speak, i believe that's a lesson that deeply embedded in your noodle up there. So you know that something that known to us as common sense, it’s more common than water at this point, the source of life itself. But you know how brainrotted this generation is and how people always says the stupidest things imaginable, especially on X.<br><br>
             So anyway, to caught you up to speed earlier today which is Nov 26, I had a numerical methods class. For those who don’t know and have been living under a rock, numerical methods is basically a technique, a jutsu we use to approximate math problems, it's basically us writing code and telling the computer to do math problems for us.<br><br>
             And earlier today my numerical methods' professor announced our final exam for the semester and he gave my class two choices, one the exam will be written based or two make a website or an app explaining and showing how the methods works. That's what i got from his explaination i believe ion know if i miss any detail.<br><br>
             Before anyone could process this absolute gift of choice, one student—bless their reflexes—blurted out their preference faster than the speed of light: written exam. Just like that. No pause. No “Hey, what do you guys think?” Nope, just their own solo decree.<br><br>
             And the kicker? The rest of the class followed like sheep in a field of bad decisions. “Yeah, sure, written exam, why not?” Cue the professor locking in the choice like it’s a done deal. Democracy? Dead. Creativity? Buried six feet under. And now, here I am, stuck studying for a written test when we could have been designing apps for astronomy.<br><br>
             So, what’s the moral of the story? If you’re gonna speak faster than your brain processes, at least don’t ruin it for everyone else. Oh, and maybe, just maybe, professors should ask for a show of hands next time. Until then, it’s back to the grind for me, while I dream of what could’ve been.</p>
